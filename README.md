"Compass" is our 4-week capstone project from a 3-month coding bootcamp with neue fische: https://www.neuefische.de/.

"Compass" stands for Compassion and helps teams improve their collaboration with more compassion. A weekly survey captures the mood in the team and is output via the Overview page. Employees can share their thoughts and ideas via the team board and enter into an exchange. A weekly challenge is designed to help the team grow together even more.
